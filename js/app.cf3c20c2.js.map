1px solid lightgrey\" />\n            <p>In this project we will use the theory and methods of Network Science to investigate the relationships between fine art painters throughout history. Ideally this analysis will serve several purposes:</p>\n            <p>Firstly it’s meant as an exploration tool. Being interested in art history is tough! How do we find new painters we might like? Going through Wikipedia’s endless lists of painters sorted by name takes it’s toll on even the most enduring of art history enthusiasts. So the point is to make a tool for easier, quicker and more entertaining discovery of artists. Hopefully the graphical layout of the network will assist with this discovery, when compared to other overviews of artists. For example it’s likely that artists located nearby each other are somewhat like each other in style, so if one knows and likes a certain artist or movement, then that could be used as a starting point for exploration. Furthermore the size of the nodes is going to be proportional with the artists’ significance, thereby making it easier not to miss any of the big ones.</p>\n            <p>Secondly art history was purposefully chosen for it’s quality of belonging to the humanities. I find it fascinating to apply quantitative methods to qualitative fields of studies such as art history. Since using these quantitative methods is not the usual way of analysing these fields, it might result in novel discoveries not obvious to the human eye without such tools.</p>\n            <p>Network Science is, in my mind, one of the more useful tools for bridging the gap between the humanities and quantitative analysis. I think it’s usefulness derives from the fact that on a microscopic level - the level of the individual nodes and links - a network is pretty qualitative, the link between two nodes represents a relationship and that’s it. But when looked at from a macroscopic perspective - the level of the entire network - all of these qualitative relationships sum up and results in the emergence of a larger system that lends itself to quantitative analysis. It’s a bit similar to how soap works to bind together fat and water, with one end of the soap molecyle being hydrophilic binding to water and the other end hydrophobic binding to fat, it enables the connection of things that otherwise would not connect.</p>\n            <p>So hopefully the use of network science will allow us discover something we didn’t know about the system of art history through time.</p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <h1 class=\"title is-4 has-text-grey-dark\">Retrieving the Dataset</h1>\n            <hr class=\"Thin\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid lightgrey\" />\n            <p>To analyze the painters we first needed to create a dataset that would serve as the basis for the network. Fortunately Wikipedia has lists of art painters through time sorted by beginning letter of last name. We used these lists to generate a list of all the painters and then used that list to download every painter’s own Wikipedia site. This resulted in a dataset with 3223 painters and a combined length of all of their Wikipedia sites of 36,138,404 characters equivelant to 15,058 standard pages (2400 characters/page).</p>\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <h1 class=\"title is-4 has-text-grey-dark\">Constructing the Network</h1>\n            <hr class=\"Thin\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid lightgrey\" />\n            <p>Having retrieved the text from each painters Wikipedia site, we then used regular expressions to automatically extract all of the links from each painters site. The links were then filtered, so that only the links pointing to other painters Wikipedia sites were left. We then constructed the graph by first creating a node for each painter in our dataset and then by placing an edge from one painter to another if the painter has a link to the other painter’s Wikipedia site on his site. The idea being that we can use the fact that a painter points to another painter in his wiki-site as a proxy for that painter being influenced by the painter that is pointed to. This way painters with a lot of in-going edges, are painters that are mentioned on many other painters’ wiki-sites and can be thought to have been proportionally infuential.</p>\n            <p>This resulted in a directed graph with 3223 nodes and 10448 edges. Which means that on average each painter’s wiki-site points to 3.24 other painters.

Do we primarely have painters that lived in the distant past or very recently? Let’s take a look:</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/graph1.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>Looking at the above histogram we can see that the dataset is primarely comprised of recent painters with a mode at around 1890. Interestingly, we do however see a spike at the beginning of the 17th century. This can probably be attributed to the late renaissance and baroque artist movements, that produced a lot of famous painters.</p>\n            <br />\n            <h3 class=\"title is-5 has-text-grey-dark\">Most Influential Painters</h3>\n            <p>Looking at the above histogram we can see that the dataset is primarely comprised of recent painters with a mode at around 1890.

The I will show the result of these here as well but not go in to deeper details about how to interpret these other centrality measures. For reference look at the explainer notebook or look up the measures yourself.

This is great, it verifies that the network works as it should. It can also be seen how the in-degrees follows an exponential (power) distribution which is a property of a scale free network. (?)</p>\n            <p>The above chart is very simple, but in spite of this, pretty interesting. I personally spent quite some time, just exploring the names of the high-ranking painters. It was interesting to find the painters that were very influential, that I had somehow missed and never heard of.</p>\n            <br />\n            <h3 class=\"title is-5 has-text-grey-dark\">Degree Distributions</h3>\n            <p>A central. property of any network is the degree distribution. sting to have a degree distribution To check out the network etc it’s interesting to have a degree distribution To check out the network etc it’s interesting to have a degree distribution To check out the network etc it’s interesting to have a degree distribution To check out the network etc it’s interesting to have a degree distribution.</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/graph3.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <h1 class=\"title is-4 has-text-grey-dark\">Analysis of Art Movements</h1>\n            <hr class=\"Thin\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid lightgrey\" />\n            <p>Looking through the wikipedia pages of the artists’ it became apparent that many, if not most, of them mentioned the art movements that the painters belonged to. In fact, they often mention a few art movements, either because the artist belonged to several or because other related movements were used in the description of the artist. We extracted the movements for each painter and used their frequency (the mode) to determine which movement should be chosen to characterize the specific painter. Sometimes the painters’ wikipedia pages even had a nice “artist infobox” where someone had specifically written the movement(s) of the artist. In those cases that or those movements were used instead of just the mode of mentioned movements. (overvej kort ned på det tekniske her).</p>\n            <p>The below bar chart shows how many painters were defined as belonging to each movement:</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/graph4.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>Unsurprisingly, It can be seen that most of the painters are assigned to the biggest movements of the period where most of them lived - around 1850 to 1950.</p>\n            <br />\n            <h3 class=\"title is-5 has-text-grey-dark\">Most Influential Painters from each Movement</h3>\n            <p>Now let’s take a look at the most influential (by in-degree) painters from each of the movements:</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/table1.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>Make the links clickable.

This made it possible to look at the distributions of the birth years of the painters for each movement. By doing so it was possible to obtain an estimation of the movements active years. 30 years were added to the birth years to to getter a better estimate, as we are not interested in the birth year of the, to the movement, assigned painters but in the years where they were performing. The minimum and maximum values of boxplots, represented by the lines should be ignored as they are obscured by outliers, instead one should look at the range from the 1st to the 3rd quartile represented by the box.</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/graph5.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>From the above diagram it can be seen that the estimates of the active years of the movements derived from the painters’ birth years are very accurate. For example: this is this and is really this and so on.

But since we have the info on the movements connected to the painters we might also have an opportunity to see how the movements are connected to each other and which movement led to other movements etc.</p>\n            <p>In order to investigate the relationships between the movements I used the already collected movement links for each painter. This time however I didn’t just use the most frequent movement but all of them. Because that was excactly what I was interested in - how the different movements were mentioned together on the same painter’s wiki-page. This left me with a set of sets of movements that were mentioned together. Much like the data a supermarket have of items that are bought together when looking at each transaction.</p>\n            <p>To analyse what pairs of items (or pairs of sets of items) are usually bought together and what items imply other items, a supermarket often performs what is known as a market basket analysis AKA association rule mining. Seeing how similar the problems were, I chose to also use association rule mining to find the associations between the different movements and then use those associations as edges in a weighted directed graph of movements. I wanted the directions as I wanted to know which movements had inspired which movements, but they weren’t obvious from the association rule mining itself. I therefore decided that the best proxy would be to use a chronological causality, meaning that when a relationship between two movements existed, the first movement (by average active time) would always be the antecedent and the latter movement would be the consequence. This made sense since a movement couldn’t really lead to another movement that was active before that movement. This resulted in the following network of movements:</p>\n            <br />\n            <p style=\"font-size:0.8em;color:grey\">(click the graph for an interactive version)</p>\n            <img src=\"./assets/ar_graph.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>(INSERT Description of findings from the graph)</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/table2.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <h1 class=\"title is-4 has-text-grey-dark\">Community Detection</h1>\n            <hr class=\"Thin\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid lightgrey\" />\n            <p>We already have the movements assigned to our painters. The movements can be viewed as communities of painters in their own right. But they’ve been assigned only by looking at the text on the wiki-pages. Therefore, it could be interesting to find communities based on the structure of the network i.e. how the painters are linked to each other. It’s then interesting to see if these communities follow the divisions of the movements or if they find other logics in the network to base their divisions on. It might be that a group of painters from different movements actually have a stronger connection to each other than to other painters from their own movement. The network has been visualized with the communities added as a colors below. (maybe several of them).</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/main_graph.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <p>Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities Comment on the found communities .</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/graph6.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/table3.png\" />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <h1 class=\"title is-4 has-text-grey-dark\">TF-IDF</h1>\n            <hr class=\"Thin\" style=\"border-top: 1px solid lightgrey\" />\n            <p>Having retrieved the text from each painters Wikipedia site, we then used regular expressions to automatically extract all of the links from each painters site. The links were then filtered, so that only the links pointing to other painters Wikipedia sites were left. We then constructed the graph by first creating a node for each painter in our dataset and then by placing an edge from one painter to another if the painter has a link to the other painter’s Wikipedia site on his site. The idea being that we can use the fact that a painter points to another painter in his wiki-site as a proxy for that painter being influenced by the painter that is pointed to. This way painters with a lot of in-going edges, are painters that are mentioned on many other painters’ wiki-sites and can be thought to have been proportionally infuential.</p>\n            <p>This resulted in a directed graph with 3223 nodes and 10448 edges. Which means that on average each painter’s wiki-site points to 3.24 other painters. The resulting graph is visualized below:</p>\n            <br />\n            <img src=\"./assets/graph7.png\" />\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport HelloWorld from \"./components/HelloWorld.vue\";\n//https://vue-particles.netlify.com/\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"app\",\n  components: {\n    HelloWorld\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n//scoped means it overwrites bulma \n<style scoped>\n#top {\n  background-color: #21d4fd;\n  background-image: linear-gradient(19deg, #f64f59, #c471ed, #12c2e9);\n  /* background-image: url(\"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/william-turner/moonlight-a-study-at-millbank.jpg\") */\n}\n\n.title:not(:last-child) {\n  margin-bottom: 0.6rem;\n}\n\np {\n  margin-bottom: 1.5em;\n}\n\nhr.Thick {\n  display: block;\n  height: 1px;\n  border: 0;\n  border-top: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255);\n  margin: 1em 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nhr.Thin {\n  display: block;\n  height: 1px;\n  border: 0;\n  border-top: 1px solid rgb(255, 255, 255);\n  margin: 0em 0 1.5em 0;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n#embedNet {\n  height: 300px;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n#plot1 {\n  height: 500px;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n#mynetwork {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 80vh;\n}\n\n/*     .is-size-7 {\n    font-size: .85rem !important\n  } */\n\n.hero-body {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n\n.navbar {\n  padding-top: 1em;\n  background-color: transparent;\n}\n\n.image {\n  padding-top: 1.5em;\n}\n\n.box {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n}\n\n.heading {\n  letter-spacing: 0.13em;\n}\n\n.justify-content-between {\n  -webkit-box-pack: justify !important;\n  -ms-flex-pack: justify !important;\n  justify-content: space-between !important;\n}\n\n#painters-gradient {\n  background-image: url(https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/research-covers/science-of-ai/gradient.jpg);\n  background-image: linear-gradient(\n      rgba(122, 87, 63, 0.397),\n      rgba(255, 245, 224, 0.363)\n    ),\n    url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_-_Inverary_Pier%2C_Loch_Fyne-_Morning_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1280px-Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_-_Inverary_Pier%2C_Loch_Fyne-_Morning_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg);\n  display: block;\n  background-size: cover;\n  background-position: center;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n</style>\n\n","import mod from \"-!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./App.vue?vue&type=template&id=3c92ec0e&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./App.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=3c92ec0e&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"3c92ec0e\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import Vue from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\nimport './../node_modules/bulma/css/bulma.css'; // Necessary to use bulma \n\nVue.config.productionTip = false\n\nnew Vue({\n  render: h => h(App),\n}).$mount('#app')\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/graph5.6d79c852.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/graph2.bceb359b.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/graph1.a9a5e8b7.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/logo.e02bd6ab.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/graph7.e84a0b66.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/topImage.39a9afb0.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/table1.78d72f7a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/ar_graph.a2a8b0c3.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
